Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 65: pawn to b2

Body:
Since the color of the pawn was not stated by the commenter, the (q)pawn is in a state of quantum superposition between black and white until the wave function is collapsed by an observer

Is the subduction ever going to stop?? a big part of the board is not visible anymore
