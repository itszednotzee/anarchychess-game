Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 37: The fractal image at a0 now has a gravitational pull. Each iteration all pieces move one square closer to it unless another move is applied to it.

Body:
That was truly painful to edit, hopefully I didnâ€™t miss anything
And I fixed the UV light effect on the mold

Top comment:
zuck gets sucked into the gravitational pull and clogs it (no more pull until something happens to zuck)
Rest of the pieces are confused because they cant see the zucker
