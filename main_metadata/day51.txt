Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 51: Black pawns notice the walkers and build fortifications with turrets to the north of the factory

Body:
The Ice age continues.

I could not be bothered to attach the turrets to the factory, so lets say the black pawns are refilling them manually lmao
Also the factory generates heat now, otherwise you wouldn't be able to see this move
