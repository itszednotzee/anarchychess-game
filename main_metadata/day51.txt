Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 51: Black pawns notice the walkers and build fortifications with turrets to the north of the factory

Body:
The Ice age continues.

I could not be bothered to attach the turrets to the factory, so lets say the black pawns are refilling them manually lmao
Also the factory generates heat now, otherwise you wouldn't be able to see this move

Top comment:
The black pawns go on strike for higher wages, health insurance, and at least four weeks of vacation a year. Union bosses threaten to release information about Kingâ€™s browser history.
