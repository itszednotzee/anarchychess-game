Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 29: the aliens are in love with Donkey, the ship beams donkey on board where he transforms into Sexy Donkey (stallion)

Body:
The mold spreads.
Zuck has (partially) fallen, but he’s defederated so it doesn’t effect him

Top comment:
the aliens attempt to woo Sexy Donkey, but he rejects their advances (his heart belongs to Dragon). distraught, heartbroken, enraged, crying a lament even the bishops and kings can hear, the aliens bring out their ultimate weapon, the trebuchet

they launch Sexy Donkey with perfect trajectory to a0. Sexy Donkey becomes caught in a recursive loop until saved
