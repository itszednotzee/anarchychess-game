The ice age begins. The board slowly freezes over, starting from the top (north) row. Frozen tiles are covered in ice and all pieces slide over them when moving. Tiles that are on fire or near fire donâ€™t get frozen

Because of the fire in the broccoli mushroom cloud, the broccoli catches fire. Some of the biters catch fire in the process too, some bring flaming pieces of broccoli to their nest.
