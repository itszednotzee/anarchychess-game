Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 4: Queen Alexandra’s Birdwing to D1

Body:
Well, I tried my best. (I actually completely forgot about this stupid post lmao)

Top comment:
Interesting development so far. Really, what you need to do is start thinking about your logistics though. If this campaign takes more than a few turns, how will you maintain supplies to the battlefield?

My vote is for supply convoy to E0. Directly behind the king so that he can help coordinate logistics deployments out to the field.

You may want to consider stationing an artillery company behind one of your knights in the next move or two. It should give you overall command and control of the board a lot more effectively than a direct engagement and exposes your forces to a lot less direct danger. Though you’ll want to also be ready for some counterbattery fire, should black decide to deploy an artillery company as well.
