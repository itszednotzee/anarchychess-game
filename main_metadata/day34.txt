Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 34: the Black King casts a Fireball and the White King sacrifices his queen to awaken the Great Old Ones

Body:
> Black King (E1) casts Fireball in a straight line up the board, exploding on first contact with an enemy. Destroying all units in a 3x3 square.

> White King sacrifices one of his Queens to the Elder Gods and begins to waken one of the Great Old Ones. All pawns begin to bleed.

Can we get less horrors beyond human comprehension this time?
The mold is going to die :(

Top comment:
I dont know where all the blood splatter just came from but its highly susceptible to mold growing over it.

All blood splatter tiles turn into mold tiles.

They still move following Conwayâ€™s way of life.

Ps: this is a permanent effect. All future blood splatter will immediately do the same.
