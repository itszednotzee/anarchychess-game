Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 69: Because the save is corrupted, C7 changes to the opposite colour

nice

Top comment:
Pawn C7, now a white pawn, advances to Blacks back row. It tries to turn into a Queen, but due to corruption of itâ€™s metadata from the previous move, turns into a MissingNo.
