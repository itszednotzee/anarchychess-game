Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 48: White walkers appear on the top row following the ice as it goes down

Body:
The Ice age continues.

Probably the most lazy edit of the game, sorry about that
I'm trying out an image hosting site recomended by [@CookieJarObserver@feddit.de](https://feddit.de/u/CookieJarObserver) on day 5

Now for an announcement:
I have uploaded every image, extra image, 2D image and metadata from all the days to a github repo [here](https://github.com/itszednotzee/anarchychess-game), I update it every day

Top comment:
the factorio dude (or gal) locates a metal deposit in the south of the board and places down a system of miners and conveyor belts to begin x exploiting it. the mining machines start producing pollution, which attracts biters.
