Title: Top comment decides next move, legal or not | day 52: The black pawns go on strike for higher wages, health insurance, and at least four weeks of vacation a year.

Body:
The Ice age continues.

Black king is still on vacation btw, also I guess white pawns are European?

Top comment:
the board begins to experience plate(board?) tectonics, with the main 2/3 of the board subducting slowly under the bottom right third.

this continues happening in the coming turns.
